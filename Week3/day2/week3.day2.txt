Overloading: 

- It refers to the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations. 
-Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method appropriate to the context, based on the number and type of arguments passed.

Java Examples:

Methods like accountCredits() can be overloaded to accept different types of arguments.
Similarly, substring() in the String class is overloaded to accept different starting and ending points for the substring.
println()

Selenium WebDriver Examples:

The frame() method in Selenium WebDriver is overloaded to allow different types of arguments like an integer (index of the frame), a String (name or ID of the frame), or a WebElement.

Advantages of Overloading:

Flexibility: Allows methods to handle different data types and numbers of arguments.
Readability: It can make the code more readable since the same method name can be used for similar actions on different types of input.
Reduces Complexity: Developers can use the same method name to perform similar actions, which simplifies code organization and maintenance.
Overriding

<----------------------------------------------------------->
Method overriding:-

Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass.
It's a key feature of runtime polymorphism and allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already provided by its parent class

Examples:

equals() of String class is overriden from the Object class
toString() of String class is overriden from the Object class
quit() of ChromiumDriver is overriden from the RemoteWebDriver Class

Super Keyword :

super has two general forms. The first calls the superclass’ constructor. The second is 
used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.

*******************************************************************
Abstraction:

Definition:

Abstraction is an OOPs concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. It's about representing features without including background details.

Advantages of Abstraction:

Simplicity: Abstraction simplifies the view of an object, so you don't need to understand the 
internal workings to use it.
Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement common methods in 
multiple subclasses.

Keyword: The "implements" keyword is used to implement an Interface

*************************************************************************
syntax :

access interface name { 
return-type method-name1(parameter-list); 
return-type method-name2(parameter-list); 
type final-varname1 = value; 
type final-varname2 = value; 
}       




In Java, variables declared inside an interface behave differently compared to those in a normal class.

👉 By default, every variable declared inside an interface is automatically:

public , static , final

Even if you don’t write those keywords, Java adds them for you behind the scenes!

👉What does that mean practically?

public:  All methods and variables are implicitly public.The variable can be accessed by any class that can see the interface.

static: The variable belongs to the interface itself, not to instances of implementing classes.

final: The variable is a constant — once assigned, it cannot be changed.

👉Why is it designed this way?

Interfaces are contracts — they define what must be done.

Constants (public static final variables) are part of that contract: they are shared facts that implementations can rely on.

Java wanted to keep interfaces pure: no state or instance-specific data inside them.
(Remember, interfaces are not supposed to "store" things.)


****************************************************************************
Java’s interfaces were originally purely abstract contracts—just method signatures—so adding any new method to an interface would break all existing implementors. Java 8 loosened that strict rule by allowing two special kinds of concrete methods:

default methods

Why? To let library designers evolve interfaces over time without forcing everybody to update their code.

Example: The Collection interface got a new stream() method in Java 8. By making it a default method (with a built-in implementation), all your old List, Set, etc. classes automatically “inherit” that behavior—you don’t have to go back and implement stream() everywhere.

static methods

Why? To group related helper or utility methods right next to the interface they serve, instead of scattering them in separate utility classes (like Collections, Objects, etc.).

Example: Map.of(...) is a static factory on the Map interface itself. It reads more naturally than Collections.mapOf(...), and it’s impossible for an implementing class to accidentally override it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step 1: Right click on the package---> new ---> interface()
step 2: create the java class ()
step 3: if the java class want to share the properties of interface means which keyword should be used ?
implements

optional (works only on JKD Version 8 or above)
step 4: create a implemented method inside the interface
---> static 
---> default




the properties of interface:-
	//unimplemented method
	public void kyc();
	//unimplemented method
	public void withDraw();

Types:

Interfaces: Used for full abstraction, they cannot have any implementation.100%
Abstract Classes: Provide partial abstraction with some implemented methods.both implemented ,unimplemented
Concrete Classes: Regular classes with full implementation.

Java Examples:

Interfaces: List, Set, Map are interfaces providing a standard set of methods to be 
implemented by concrete collections.

Abstract Classes: AbstractList, AbstractCollection provide skeletal implementations that 
can be used as starting points for creating concrete collections.

Selenium WebDriver Examples:

Interfaces: WebDriver, WebElement, Alert are interfaces representing abstract concepts in browser automation.
Abstract Classes: By is an abstract class providing methods to locate elements.
Concrete Classes: RemoteWebDriver is a concrete implementation of the WebDriver interface.
