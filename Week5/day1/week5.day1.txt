For after methods (afterSuite, afterClass, …​): If set to true, this configuration method will be run even if one or more methods invoked previously failed or was skipped.


2) enabled

Whether methods on this class/method are enabled.

3) groups

The list of groups this class/method belongs to.

4) inheritGroups

If true, this method will belong to groups specified in the @Test annotation at the class level.

5) onlyForGroups

Only for @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod. If specified, then this setup/teardown method will only be invoked if the corresponding test method belongs to one of the listed groups.

6) dataProvider

The name of the data provider for this test method.

7) dataProviderClass

The class where to look for the data provider. If not specified, the data provider will be looked on the class of the current test method or one of its base classes. If this attribute is specified, the data provider method needs to be static on the specified class.

8) dependsOnGroups

The list of groups this method depends on.

9) dependsOnMethods

The list of methods this method depends on.

10) description

The description for this method.

11) expectedExceptions

The list of exceptions that a test method is expected to throw. If no exception or a different than one on this list is thrown, this test will be marked a failure.

12) invocationCount

The number of times this method should be invoked.

13) invocationTimeOut

The maximum number of milliseconds this test should take for the cumulated time of all the invocationcounts. This attribute will be ignored if invocationCount is not specified.

14) priority

The priority for this test method. Lower priorities will be scheduled first.

15) successPercentage

The percentage of success expected from this method

16) singleThreaded

If set to true, all the methods on this test class are guaranteed to run in the same thread, even if the tests are currently being run with parallel="methods". This attribute can only be used at the class level and it will be ignored if used at the method level. 
Note: this attribute used to be called sequential (now deprecated).

17) timeOut

The maximum number of milliseconds this test should take.

18) threadPoolSize

The size of the thread pool for this method. The method will be invoked from multiple threads as specified by invocationCount. NOTE: this attribute is ignored if invocationCount is not specified
