🚀 Low-Level Language vs High-Level Language 🚀

⚙ Low-Level Language ⚙
🔹 Abstraction: 🔧 Low abstraction (closer to machine code).
🔹 Ease of Use: 🛠 Harder to read/write (requires hardware knowledge).
🔹 Examples: 💻 Assembly, 🔋 Machine code.
🔹 Performance: 🚀 Extremely fast (direct hardware control).
🔹 Memory Management: 🧑💻 Manual (programmer handles memory).

🔹 Use Cases:

🖥 Operating systems (Linux kernel).
📶 Embedded systems (IoT devices).
🔌 Device drivers & firmware.
🔹 Portability: 🔒 Not portable (hardware-specific).

🌟 High-Level Language 🌟
🔹 Abstraction: 🧠 High abstraction from hardware (closer to human language).
🔹 Ease of Use: 📖 Easier to read, write, and maintain.
🔹 Examples: 🐍 Python, ☕ Java, 🔷 C#, 🌐 JavaScript, 💎 Ruby.
🔹 Performance: 🐢 Slightly slower (due to abstraction layers).
🔹 Memory Management: 🗑 Automatic (e.g., garbage collection).

🔹 Use Cases:

🌍 Web dev (JavaScript, Python).
📱 Mobile apps (Java for Android, Swift for iOS).
🤖 AI/ML & Data Science (Python).
🔹 Portability: 🌐 Highly portable (runs on multiple platforms).



💡 When to Use?

High-Level: For quick development, cross-platform apps, and ease of use.

Low-Level: For performance-critical tasks (e.g., OS kernels) and direct hardware control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚀 Programming Languages Classification 🌍

🔹 Native Languages 🖥
✅ Compiled directly into machine code (CPU executes it).


🔹 Semi-Native Languages ⚙
✅ Needs runtime support but still compiles to native code.


🔹 Non-Native Languages 🌐
✅ Runs on a virtual machine (VM), not directly compiled to machine code.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚀 Java: Native, Semi-Native, or Non-Native? 🤔

Java is a 🌍 non-native language because it doesn’t run directly on the operating system like C or C++. Instead, it runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) ☕, which makes it platform-independent! 🖥📱

✨ Why?

✅ Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) – Java code compiles into bytecode (.class files), which can run on any OS with a JVM! 🎯
✅ Not tied to a single OS – Unlike native languages (C, C++), which generate machine code for specific platforms.
✅ More secure 🔒 & flexible – Since Java apps run in a controlled environment (JVM sandbox).

So, Java is a non-native, interpreted & platform-independent language that gives portability & security! 🚀🔥

The Java Development Kit (JDK) includes several compilers and tools that are essential for Java development. Here are the main compilers and tools available in the JDK:

1)javac: This is the primary Java compiler included in the JDK. It compiles Java source code (.java files) into Java bytecode (.class files), which can then be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2)java: The Java application launcher. It is used to run Java applications by starting the JVM and executing the bytecode.

3)javadoc: This tool generates API documentation in HTML format from Java source code. It extracts comments and annotations from the source code to create comprehensive documentation.

4)jdb: The Java Debugger. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to debug Java applications by setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables.

5)jar: The Java Archive tool. It is used to create and manipulate JAR files, which are used to package Java classes and resources.

6)javac -h: This tool generates C header and source files from a Java class. It is used for writing native methods (methods implemented in languages like C or C++).

💡 What is JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler? 🚀



⚡ How does JIT work?
1️.When you run a Java program, the JVM first interprets the bytecode 🖥📜
2️.But interpretation is slow 🐢, so the JIT Compiler jumps in! 🚀
3️.JIT compiles frequently used bytecode into native machine code ⚙💾
4️.Now, the CPU can execute it super fast! ⚡⚡

✨ Why is JIT Awesome?
✅ Faster execution after initial runs 🏎💨
✅ Optimizes hotspot code for better performance 🎯🔥
✅ Combines interpretation + compilation for efficiency ⚖

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation was first invented in 1960 by John McCarthy for Lisp programming language! 🏛💡

👉 However, JIT became widely popular when Java introduced it in the HotSpot JVM (1999) 🚀🔥.
👉 Today, JIT is used in Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP, and many more languages! 🌍⚡

So, JIT is an old but powerful idea that keeps modern programming fast & efficient! 🎯💻

JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is a component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 🖥🔥.
The JVM has different parts, and JIT works inside the Execution Engine ⚙, where it converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code for faster execution 🚀.

So, JIT is a key performance booster in the JVM! ⚡💡

📌 Pascal Casing vs Camel Casing 📌

🌟 Pascal Casing 🌟

Definition: The first letter of every word is UPPERCASE, including the first word.

Example:
PascalCaseExample : EmployeeRecord, BankAccount 💼

Usage:
✅ Project names, Class names (e.g., class UserProfile).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a class is a logical construct; an object has physical reality

When you create a class, you will specify the code and data that constitute that class. 
Collectively, these elements are called members of the class. Specifically, the data defined by 
the class are referred to as member variables or instance variables. The code that operates on 
that data is referred to as member methods or just methods. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class name

Type name is not valid. A Java type name must not start or end with a blank-> No spaces, no special symbols (@, #, !, etc.), no Reserved keyword
Type name is not valid. The type name '9' is not a valid identifier  --> Must start with a letter or underscore (not a digit)
Type name is discouraged. By convention, Java type names usually start with an uppercase letter --> Should follow PascalCase (by convention)
-----------------
🌟 Camel Casing 🌟

Definition: The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with UPPERCASE.

Example:
camelCaseExample, employeeRecord, bankAccount 📦

Usage:
✅ Variable names (e.g., int totalCount).
✅ Method parameters (e.g., void printMessage(String messageText)).

🌈 Why Does It Matter? 🌈

Readability: Makes code cleaner and easier to read! 👀✨

Language Standards:

Java/C#: PascalCase for classes 🏛, camelCase for variables/methods 🔧.

JavaScript: camelCase for functions 📝, PascalCase for React components ⚛.

Consistency: Follow your team’s style guide to avoid chaos! 🧩🤝
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java programs are a collection of
whitespace, 
identifiers, 
literals, 
comments, 
operators, 
separators, 
and keywords.
