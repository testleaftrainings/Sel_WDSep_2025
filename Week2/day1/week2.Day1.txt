Method Signature:


📝 Java Class Fundamentals: How Methods, Objects, and Variables Work Together

🔷 1. Class

	A blueprint that defines variables (data) and methods (behavior).


🔷 2.Local Variables(Fields / Attributes)

	Method variables:Declared inside the method

   2A.Global Variables (Fields / Attributes)

	Instance variables: Declared inside the class but outside any method.

	They hold the state of each object.

	🧠 When to Use Global Variables:

-------->The data represents the state of the object.
 
---------->You need to use the same data across multiple methods.

------------->You want cleaner method signatures (no repetitive passing of parameters).

------------------>Methods and  global varibales were properties of the class

✅ Purpose of Variables in Real Testing Projects
A variable stores data that can be reused or changed later in the test.

🔹 Why we use variables?

1. Data Storage – Hold input test data like String username = "admin";
2. Dynamic Handling – Can store values read from external files (Excel, JSON, Properties)
3. Parameterization – Store values that can be changed based on test case
4. Readability & Debugging – Easier to debug and read instead of hardcoding values
5. Flexibility – Values can be changed during runtime (e.g., in data-driven testing)

🔷 3. Methods

	Define the actions or behaviors that can be performed using the object's data (variables).

	Can access and modify instance variables.

✅ Purpose of Methods in Real Testing Projects

A method is a reusable block of code that performs a specific action.

🔹 Why we use methods?

1. Reusability – To avoid repeating the same code again and again.
e.g., login(username, password) can be reused in many test cases.

2. Modularity – Breaks large test flows into small, manageable steps.
e.g., clickButton(), enterText(), verifyText()

3. Maintainability – If the UI changes, we only need to update the method, not every test case.

4. Readability – Methods with meaningful names make test cases easy to understand.
e.g., clickLoginButton() is more readable than writing code directly in the test.

5. Separation of concerns – Test logic is separated from implementation (as in Page Object Model).

🔷 4. Object

	An instance of the class.

	It gets its own copy of instance variables.

	Used to call methods and access variables.

🧱 In Java, everything is class-based.
Java supports two kinds of methods:

1) Instance methods (most common)

2) Static methods

✅ 1. Instance Methods – Require Object Creation

💡 Why?
Because instance methods belong to an instance (object) of a class, not the class itself. They need access to non-static fields (i.e., data unique to each object).

🤔 Why make methods instance-based?

 --- follow OOP principles like encapsulation and abstraction
 --- for real-world entities with state and behavior, object creation is necessary.

🚫 2. Static Methods – Do NOT Need Object Creation

💡 Why?
Because static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific object.

🔷 5. Constructor

	A special method used to initialize object variables when the object is created.
